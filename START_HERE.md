## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is the site really ready to deploy?**
A: Yes! All critical issues are fixed. The 8 "broken" links in the analyzer are in archived files, not your main site.

**Q: What about placeholder images?**
A: 18 placeholder images (gray boxes) should be replaced with real ones from 23c.jp as they become available.

**Q: What about stub pages?**
A: 19 pages have "content coming soon" placeholder text. Update these with real content as needed.

**Q: Can I delete fetched_pages?**
A: Yes, it's only reference material. The main site doesn't use these files.

**Q: How do I test locally?**
A: Run `python3 -m http.server` in this directory, then open http://localhost:8000

**Q: How often should I run link_analyzer?**
A: Once a month to check for new broken links.
